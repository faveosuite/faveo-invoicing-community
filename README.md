## Features

Check out the detailed features of Agora Invoicing in our [Agora Features Wiki](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/agora-invoicing-community/wiki/Agora-Features).

## Error Reporting

Agora Invoicing uses [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) to monitor application stability in production environments. This helps us quickly identify issues and release bug fixes and updates.

### Disable Error Reporting for Development
If you are customizing the application in a development environment, we recommend disabling error reporting to avoid unnecessary alerts. You can easily disable error reporting from the **Error Logs and Debugging** section in the admin panel, or by setting the environment to `development` in your `.env` file.

### Reporting Issues or Customizations
You can still report any issues or share your customizations via our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/agora-invoicing-community/issues). If your changes follow our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/agora-invoicing-community/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md), we may integrate them into the main application.
