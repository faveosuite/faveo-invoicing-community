Agora is a billing and subscription management system for SaaS and other software businesses, handling signups, provisioning, billing, and support.

Agora can also be customized according to requirements, and we undertake such requests.

Agora Features

Error Reporting
--------------------------
Agora uses [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) to monitor application stability in a production environment. It helps us provide bug fixes and feature updates after analyzing the logs and crash reports for the application. **If you are customizing the application in a development environment, we request you to disable this error reporting.** This will allow us to ignore the errors that occur during your development cycle, enabling us to focus more on the exceptions/bugs occurring in the live system of other users in the Faveo community. It can be easily disabled from the "Error logs and debugging" option in the admin panel or by updating your app environment to development in `.env`.

You can still report issues on our [GitHub Issue page](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/agora-invoicing-community/issues) by providing proper information about the changes you are trying to implement. We assure you that the Faveo community will help you, and your customization can be a part of the Faveo application if it follows our contributing guidelines.
