#
# options{ timeout } is what Jenkins enforces. QA_BUILD_TIMEOUT_MINUTES is what every
# clamp derives its own ceiling from — the executor's hard stop, and the decision
# whether an issue can still be started. A declarative option cannot read a variable,
# so the number has to be a literal there and a variable everywhere else.
#
# Drift is silent and one-directional in the worst way: if the env var is LARGER than
# the real timeout, the executor is told it has time it does not have, runs past the
# abort, and the build is killed before publishing or teardown — no report on the PR,
# a database left behind, and a port still held.
#
# The pipeline script — JENKINS-PIPELINE-SCRIPT.groovy — is pasted directly into
# the Jenkins job's "Pipeline script" field and is deliberately NOT committed.
# There is nothing in-repo to check by default, so this takes the path as $1,
# or QA_PIPELINE_SCRIPT_PATH. With neither set, it explains that and skips
# (exit 0) rather than failing — a local developer convenience check, not
# something CI can run unattended any more.

build-timeout: no pipeline script path given.

JENKINS-PIPELINE-SCRIPT.groovy lives outside this repo now — it's pasted directly
into the Jenkins job's "Pipeline script" field, not committed. Point this check at
a local copy of it (e.g. saved from the Jenkins UI) to run it:

  bash ci/qa/tests/build-timeout.sh /path/to/JENKINS-PIPELINE-SCRIPT.groovy
  QA_PIPELINE_SCRIPT_PATH=/path/to/it bash ci/qa/tests/build-timeout.sh

Skipping — not a failure.
